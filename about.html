        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Fuzhou, China. 6 years ago, my family and I moved to United States and lived in Princeton, NJ.
        My family decided to move to California when I got offer from UCI. So now here we are. I like exploring new things. Two of my
        many hobbies are travelling and eating with family and friends.</p>
        <p>This past Spring and Summer, I studied abroad to Osaka, Japan. It was one of my most valuable memories so far in my life.
        I did a computer science research there and met lots of people from a different culture. I believe that any kinds of knowledge
        would take me one step further in my life. So that's probably why I embrace all the new things happening in my life.</p>
        <p>Lastly, this project is a bit challenging but fun. It's challenging because I didn't have any experience doing web design
        like this, expecially from scratch. The start was a bit rough but I started to taste the fun part of it once I have some
        components set up. In the future, I want to work in a game development company, probably in a project management team. I want
        to bridge and gap between technology and business.</p>
