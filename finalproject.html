            <h4>User Interview</h4>
            <div class="content">
              For the user interviews, I have purposedly chosen friends from different fields such as informatics, computer science, and
              illustration. Tthe questions focused on users' background, perspective on personal 
              profile websites, and features. The general questions include the opinions on determinants for a good and bad profile,
              as well as general expectations. For some interviewees, I have also asked about specific features such as color
              setting and message board to see their preferences. The user interviews helped me determine a general standard for
              a personal profile website and it also helped me learn about how people from different industries have different expectations for a
              personal profile. In general, it helps me generate a more concrete and accurate development goal for my own profile.

            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <div class="content">
              A competitor analysis is an important part for learning what other people do in the same market. In this project, I've chosen
              3 different profile websites to analyze. They are from three types of people: computer scientist, financial
              advisor, and creative designer. As a business information management major, I study both computer science and business.
              By choosing both computer scientist and financial advisor's profiles, I am able to see the different emphasis for each industry. 
              The reason why I chose a creative designer was to see how an artist would structure the
              profile and how that can be different from the other two.

            <h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
            <div class="content">
              A feature value matrix is a way for developer to calculate the value of a feature based on its business value, user value, 
              and technical effort. With a score for each category, we're able to determine which features should have higher priority
              for development and which features are less important. I selected those features mainly based on my interview feedback and
              the nice features I found during the competitor analysis.

            <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
            <div class="content">
              The feature value matirx is a good reference to determine which features to prioritize. I prioritized the features based on
              the number calculated from the feature value matrix. Some of the features are cool to have but not necessary and others are
              easier to incorporate with higher value. With the list of features, I will have direction on which features that I can add
              to my interface.

            <div class="content">
              The user stories is a tool used to learn about different perspectives of different users. My user stories include a variety
              of potential users. I tried to imagine that who, even with only minimal interests, might visit my website. I thought about their
              intentions of visiting and how they could be satisfied. It is definitely one of the most interesting part of this project that
              really triggered me to think out of box.

            <h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
            <div class="content">
              The cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method that invloves several evaluators walking through a series of tasks as
              users. It is important because it is a relatively cheap and fast way to learn how the system perform and learn how users perceive
              things on an interface. One of the challenges is definitely to come up with effective tasks for users to go through. This is one of 
              the determinant portions in the evaluation because everything else is based upon performing those tasks.

            <h4>User Test</h4>
            <div class="content">
              I have done a click test and a five-second user experience test. The click test is straightforward, asking users to quickly find the
              button they can click to learn more about me. I chose this in order to see the easiness of locating the navigation bar and understanding
              the content for each choices in navigation. The 5-second test shows a screenshot of my home page for 5 seconds and asks testers to answer
              three questions based on what they've seen. I used this to see how efficient the home page is in providing quick first impression information.
              The result for click test shows most people are able to understand and click at the same place to learn more about me, and the 5-second test
              tells me that my home page is not presenting myself in a efficient way because of the poor structure of the information. The challenges is to
              avoid bias because some people are messing with the questions.

        <h3 style="font-size: x-large;">Summary of Findings</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Before the user research and user testing, I thought that a website should be as clean and simple as possible. Therefore, I have
          simplified my website to the degree where not enough content is provided. By conducting the user research, I found that people like
          to see a wide range of things on a website from animation and customized color setting, to message board and photo albums. All of these
          features seem to be reasonable to add to a personal website. However, in the feature value matrix, I had to really think from
          the time spent, the difficulty, and the payoff for each feature, to actually determine which features are feasible. I had also to consider
          the situation when several features have similar feature values, how the priority should be ordered. Since my website is extermely simple,
          this situation also made me think about whether these features with similar feature values should be considered as the basics for a
          personal profile website. The research results has inspired me and triggered lots of ideas in my mind.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the user testing allows me to see the potential doable improvement from people's actual experience with my website.
          During my cognitive walkthrough, I saw people mostly having no problem navigating between different pages and get information they want.
            Some downsides brought up by my evaluators includes the plain color setting, the lack of information, the long paragraph descriptions,
            and the lack of focus on the website. These feedback provided me with direction of where I can start from to change my website. One example
            is that I can present the information in my home page in the form of bullet point. This could maximize the information people perceive
            on their very first view on the website.</p>
          <p>It is challenging to find a balance between what I am currently capable of doing and what I want to add to my website. Since my programming
            skill on HTML/CSS or Javascript is still limited, I would have to take that into consideration as well. Also throughout the interviews, it was
            challenging to guide the interviewees and have them talk about their experience and perspectives. Some people might never look at a website
            thinking what's good and what's bad about it. They usually have hard time verbalizikng what specifically each website is made up of to satisfy them.

        <h3 style="font-size: x-large;">Incorporation of Findings</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of how you incorporated findings and/or how you plan to incorporate findings.  Be sure to include any challenges faced and how you arrived at solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved and you actually took steps or plant to take steps to improve it.
