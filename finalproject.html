            <h4>User Interview</h4>
            <div>
              For the user interviews, I have purposedly chosen friends from different fields such as informatics, computer science, and
              illustration. I focused on the questions regarding users' personal background, professional background, perspective for personal 
              profile websites, and specific features. The general questions include the opinions on determinants for a good and bad profile,
              as well as general expectations. For specific interviewees, I have also asked about some specific features such as color
              setting and message board to see their preferences. I think the user interviews really help me determine a general standard for
              a personal profile website and it also helps me learn about how people from different industry have different expectations for a
              personal profile. This helps me generate a more concrete and accurate development goal for my own profile.

            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <div>
              A competitor analysis is a important part to learn what other people does in the same market. In this project, I've chosen
              3 different personal profile websites to analyze. Three profiles are from three types of people: computer scientist, financial
              advisor, and creative designer. As a business information management major, I study both computer science and business.
              By choosing the computer scientist and financial advisor's profiles, I am able to see the different emphasis from people
              working in each industry. The reason why I choose a creative designer is just to see how an artist would structure their
              profiles and how that can be different from the other two.
