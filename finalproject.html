            <h4>User Interview</h4>
            <div class="content">
              For the user interviews, I have purposedly chosen friends from different fields such as informatics, computer science, and
              illustration. I focused on the questions regarding users' personal background, professional background, perspective for personal 
              profile websites, and specific features. The general questions include the opinions on determinants for a good and bad profile,
              as well as general expectations. For specific interviewees, I have also asked about some specific features such as color
              setting and message board to see their preferences. I think the user interviews really help me determine a general standard for
              a personal profile website and it also helps me learn about how people from different industry have different expectations for a
              personal profile. This helps me generate a more concrete and accurate development goal for my own profile.

            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <div class="content">
              A competitor analysis is a important part to learn what other people does in the same market. In this project, I've chosen
              3 different personal profile websites to analyze. Three profiles are from three types of people: computer scientist, financial
              advisor, and creative designer. As a business information management major, I study both computer science and business.
              By choosing the computer scientist and financial advisor's profiles, I am able to see the different emphasis from people
              working in each industry. The reason why I choose a creative designer is just to see how an artist would structure their
              profiles and how that can be different from the other two.

            <h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
            <div class="content">
              A feature value matrix is a way for developer to calculate the value of a feature based on its business value, user value, 
              and technical effort. With a score for each category, we're able to determine which features should have higher priority
              for development and which features are less important. I selected those features mainly based on my interview feedback and
              the nice features I found during the competitor analysis.

            <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
            <div class="content">
              The feature value matirx is a good reference to determine which features to prioritize. I prioritized the features based on
              the number calculated from the feature value matrix. Some of the features are cool to have but not necessary and others are
              easier to incorporate with higher value. With the list of features, I will have direction on which features that I can add
              to my interface.

            <h4>User Stories</h4>
            <div class="content">
              The user stories is a tool used to learn about different perspectives of different users. My user stories include a variety
              of potential users. I tried to imagine that who, even with only minimal interests, might visit my website. I thought about their
              intentions of visiting and how they could be satisfied. It is definitely one of the most interesting part of this project that
              really triggered me to think out of box.

            <h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
            <div class="content">
              The cognitive walkthrough is a usability evaluation method that invloves several evaluators walking through a series of tasks as
              users. It is important because it is a relatively cheap and fast way to learn how the system perform and learn how users perceive
              things on an interface. One of the challenges is definitely to come up with effective tasks for users to go through. This is one of 
              the determinant portions in the evaluation because everything else is based upon performing those tasks.

            <h4>User Test</h4>
            <div class="content">
              I have done a click test and a five-second user experience test. The click test is straightforward, asking users to quickly find the
              button they can click to learn more about me. I chose this in order to see the easiness of locating the navigation bar and understanding
              the content for each choices in navigation. The 5-second test shows a screenshot of my home page for 5 seconds and asks testers to answer
              three questions based on what they've seen. I used this to see how efficient the home page is in providing quick first impression information.
              The result for click test shows most people are able to understand and click at the same place to learn more about me, and the 5-second test
              tells me that my home page is not presenting myself in a efficient way because of the poor structure of the information. The challenges is to
              avoid bias because some people are messing with the questions.

        <div class="content">
          Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of your findings.  Be sure to include insights from conducting your research and tests as well as any challenges faced.  If you are not quite sure of what conclusions can be drawn, pose a hypothesis as to possible solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved.

          Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of how you incorporated findings and/or how you plan to incorporate findings.  Be sure to include any challenges faced and how you arrived at solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved and you actually took steps or plant to take steps to improve it.
